The Origination Proposals screen lists all current origination proposals and their current statuses.  

When the records first appear here, they will have the status “Awaiting Internal Approval” and they must be approved by senior management and the distribution team before continuing.  

At this point, it is also possible to remove cashflows from the proposal. This will remove the cashflow from the proposal and put the cashflow into an invalid status.  

Once approved the status moves to **Awaiting Client Approval**, where necessary client approval must be sought before submitting to trade. Once submitted to trade the record will have the status “Submitted To Trade” and the process then switches to external processes.
