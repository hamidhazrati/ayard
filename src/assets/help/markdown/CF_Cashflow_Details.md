## Cashflow file details

When you select and click on a cashflow file record from the cashflow files screen, the cashflow details screen will open, giving more detailed information about valid and invalid/rejected cashflows, and gross and FMV amounts for the cashflow file.

In the top half of the screen, you will see:
- details of the cashflow file such as entities and contract,
- details of the cashflows including number of cashflows, valid and invalid gross amounts and valid FMV amount and
- processing details such as current status, upload date, processed date, filename and cashflow file ID.

In the lower half of the screen, there will be 2 tabs:
- Valid Cashflows - detailing the valid cashflow with information such as counterparties, invoice ID, currencies and amounts, cashflow status and so on.
- Invalid Cashflows - detailing the invalid cashflows with similar information as the valid cashflows and the **Invalid Reason** column which helps you to decide what to do about the invalid cashflows. Refer to the help section about [Cashflow Exceptions](https://internal/assets/help/markdown/CF_MCF_Manage_exceptions.md 'Exceptions') for further information about how to work with invalid cashflows.
