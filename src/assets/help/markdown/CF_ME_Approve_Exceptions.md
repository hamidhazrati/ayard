These instructions assume that you are logged into Verdi and that you have suitable permissions to verify changes to cashflow exceptions.  

Once a cashflow file has been uploaded and checked, the cashflows will be marked as Valid or Invalid. When the Maker notifies you that the exceptions have been dealt with, you can view the results in Verdi and submit for reprocessing.  

1.	From the Verdi dashboard, click on the **Manage Exceptions** button.
2.	Use the exception ID sent to you by the Maker to locate the required exceptions.  

> Exceptions processed for you will have the status **In Review Override** or **In Review Release**.  

3.	Click on each exception row in turn.
4.	Review the reasons given for releasing or overriding as appropriate.
5.	When satisfied, click the **Confirm** button to continue.
6.	Enter a reason for confirmation and click the **Confirm** button.
7.	Once all exceptions for a cashflow are Confirmed, Verdi will reprocess the cashflow and show accordingly in the Cashflow file section. Rejected exception updates will remain as they are.
8.	When you have confirmed or released all the required exception changes, notify the Maker that it has been done.
