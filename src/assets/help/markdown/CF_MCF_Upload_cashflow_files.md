> This may take a while, depending on the size of the file. When the file has finished uploading, if successful the confirmation notification will appear, and your file will appear in the list of cashflows with the status “Pending Processing”.
The files status will also move through “Start Processing”, the “End Processing”, at which point the file can be approved by your Checker.

If the file upload is unsuccessful, the notification will give the reasons for failure so you can correct them and try again.

> **Make sure that you email the person responsible to let them know that a cashflow file is ready for them to check and include the cashflow file ID so that they can find it and the excel spreadsheet that you uploaded. The process cannot continue without the checks being completed.**
