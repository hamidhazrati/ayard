Where many results are displayed in a table, sometimes the screen is not big enough to display them all, so the content is divided up into equal amounts and displayed on separate pages.  

When this happens, a set of controls appears at the bottom of the page allowing you to move through the pages to find the content you're looking for.  

You can select the number of results shown on each page from 10, 25, 50 or 100 (the total number of results are shown next to this control, to help you to decide how many to display).  

You can also move forwards and back through the pages as required or select the specific page number to view.
