These instructions assume that you are logged into Verdi and that you have suitable permissions to work with cashflow exceptions.  

Once a cashflow file has been uploaded and checked, the cashflows will be marked as Valid or Invalid. When the Checker notifies you that the file has been processed you can view the results in Verdi.  

1.	From the Verdi dashboard, click on the **Manage Cashflow Files** button.
2.	When the Cashflow files screen opens, locate the required cashflow file.
3.	Click on the cashflow file row.
4.	The processed cashflow file screen will open.
5.	At the bottom of the screen there will be two tabs, one for **valid cashflows** and one for **invalid cashflows**. To progress, you must deal with invalid cashflows as appropriate.
6.	Make a note of the required **Cashflow ID**.
7.	Return to the Verdi Dashboard (Home).
8.	Click on the **Manage Exceptions** button.
9.	Use the Cashflow ID noted above to locate the required exceptions.
10.	Click on each exception row in turn.  

From here you have two options (the Cancel button closes the exception details without changing anything):  

-	**Release** – For example if the contract/facility needs to be changed to accommodate this cashflow, and the contract change has been done; Click the Release button to allow this cashflow to be re-processed with the updated contract/facility details.
-	**Override** – If the reason for the failure can be overridden as a one-off action, click the Override button to allow this cashflow to be validated when the file is re-processed.  

Please note that whichever action you choose (apart from Cancel) you must enter a reason for that action which will be checked before the file is re-processed.

11.	Make a note of the Exception IDs that you have changed, and let your Checker know so that the file can be re-processed with the new information.
