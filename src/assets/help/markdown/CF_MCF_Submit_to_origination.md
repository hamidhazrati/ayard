These instructions assume that you are logged into Verdi and that you have suitable permissions to submit cashflow files.

Once a cashflow file has been processed in Verdi, and exceptions have been dealt with as required, the cashflows can be submitted to origination proposals for the next stage.

1. From the Verdi dashboard, click on the **Manage Cashflow Files** button.
2. Find and click on the required cashflow file.
3. When the file details open, check that the details are as expected.
4. Click the **Submit to origination proposal** button.

If there were any remaining “Rejected” cashflows at the point of submission, Verdi automatically converts them to “Invalid”.
