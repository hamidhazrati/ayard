## Cashflow Files

Cashflow files are the files which are uploaded into Verdi from clients, containing rows of cashflows to be processed by Verdi, ultimately resulting in the client entities receiving their funding and the cashflows being traded on the market.  
At the time of writing, cashflow files must be in Excel format (.xslx) and in an agreed structure.  
As cashflow files are uploaded they are processed into their individual cashflows and assessed against contracts to make sure that they conform to the agreed limits and rules.  
If required, rejected cashflows can be reprocessed after contract and/or limit changes, overridden to allow exceptions as a one-off, or hard-rejected (made invalid) and not processed in this cashflow file.  
Once processed into valid cashflows, they are submitted to origination proposal, which is then subject to further verification before eventually being submitted to trade.
