These instructions assume that you are logged into Verdi and that you have suitable permissions to edit origination proposals.  

Once you have submitted a file to origination proposal it is possible to remove cashflows from the proposal at this point. Any cashflows removed at this point will be removed from the proposal and the cashflow will be put into an invalid state.  

1.	From the Verdi dashboard, click on the **Manage Origination Proposals** button.
2.	Find the required origination proposal record using the cashflow ID that it was created from.

> The record should have a status of “Awaiting Internal Approval”.

3.	Click on the record and open the proposal.
4.	Click the **Edit** button.
5.	Deselect the checkboxes of any cashflows to remove from the file.
6.	Click **Save** to continue.

> This will remove any deselected cashflows from the proposal, and return those cashflows to an invalid state.
