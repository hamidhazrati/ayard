To help manage multiple exceptions there is an option to **Group Exceptions**.  

When selected, exceptions are grouped by **Exception Type**, **Primary Entity**, **Related Entity** and **Status**.  

To group, click on the **Group Exceptions** toggle in the upper-left hand corner of the screen, and to ungroup, click on **Group exceptions** toggle again.
